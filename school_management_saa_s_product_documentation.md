- **Online & Offline Modes:** Secure browser for online tests; offline CSV import of paper‑graded exams. Integration with proctoring services for remote assessments.
- **Auto‑Grading & Analytics:** Immediate scoring for objective items; item analysis reports (difficulty, discrimination indices); dashboards showing performance by class, subject, and student cohort.

### 3.6 Student Analytics & Reporting

- **Dashboards:** KPIs like average attendance rate, grade distributions, behavior incidents, and learning objective completion.
- **Custom Reports:** Ad hoc report builder with filters (date range, class, teacher), export to XLSX/CSV/PDF, and scheduled email delivery.
- **Predictive Insights:** ML‑powered early warning system highlighting students at risk of falling behind based on combined attendance, grades, and engagement metrics.
